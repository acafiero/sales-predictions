# Medium Outlets Will Outperform Large Outlets
## Data shows Medium-sized outlets are projected the top performers in sales metrics

**Andrew J Cafiero**: 

### Business problem:

Of the various grocery outlets within the company, those that classify as "medium-sized" will continue to perform better in reference to sales when compared to those that are classified as "Small" and "Large".


### Data:
The data utilized was provided from a third-party sourced and was cleaned in order to find a more accurate representation of sales figures across the company.

## Methods
- Seeing there was a lot of excess data within the dataset, I chose to drop several of the categories that would not apply to an in-depth look at sales metrics.
- Some of the more applicable categories such as Outlet Size itself had some discrepancies in labeling (ie: 'High' in place of 'Large')
- Looking to see which categories would give the best insight into sales metrics, visualtions of the data were created to help align some of the intersecting factors such as Total Sales figures for each classification of outlet size, and how the listed price of each item impacted the Total sales of each individual outlet.
- Using these graphs as a reference, processing the data through algorithms allowed me to see how much margin existed between the actual sales figures themselves when impacted by some of the various categories present in the dataset.
